Risk-Mitigation.Group Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains RMG’s
policy regarding the privacy and protection of information that you

information that RMG gathers from you will only be used in the manner
set forth in this Policy.
</div>

<strong>2. Changes to the Policy.</strong> RMG may periodically change this Policy
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

through updates to the Policy web page. If RMG makes changes to its
Policy, a notice will be posted on the home page for each Site for a
period of sixty (60) days. It is your responsibility to periodically
check the home page for each Site and the Policy page to review any
changes. In the event you do not agree with the changes to the Policy,
you must immediately stop using the Site. Should you continue use of the
Site after a change is posted, your continued use confirms your
acceptance of the change or changes to this Policy.
</div>

<strong>3. Information RMG Gathers.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

RMG gathers information that you
voluntarily provide. Some of that information is “personal information”
and some of that information pertains to your usage of the Site (“usage
information”).
</div>

<strong>a. Personal Information.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

Under California law, the term “personal
information” does not include publicly available information that is
lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or
local government records.</p>
<p>The Term “personal information” generally includes information that you
voluntarily provide RMG through the registration process, or by
responding to RMG surveys, such as address and telephone number.
<strong>However, a profile administrator’s name and position title are not
considered personal information.</strong> By creating an account, you agree to
display your name and/or position title on the public profiles you
manage. Additionally, a user may chooses to make other personal
information available to the public by selecting the checkbox labeled
“Make public” associated with each data element of your personal
information. Personal information also includes your social security
number, driver’s license number, any banking information, or health care
information; however, RMG will not ask you about those types of personal
information and RMG will never ask you for your Social Security Number.
However, if you elect to purchase goods or services from RMG through the
Site, and you elect to use a credit card, RMG will collect credit card
information for that transaction. If you so request, RMG may save or
“remember” that credit card information for future purchases as a
convenience to you. RMG may also ask you demographical questions about
such things as your age, marital status, income, children, religion, and
occupation. Unless you voluntarily disclose your personal information on
the Site, your personal information will not be disclosed by RMG to
third parties except as provided under section 6, below.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Policy, personal information also includes, but
is not limited to, information about you that you voluntarily publish,
submit, or post on the Site, such as images, documents, writings, links
to other sites, blogs, and other information about you, your occupation,
and your family that you elect to publish. This form of personal
information, when published, submitted, or posted by you is, by that act
of publication, made available to the general public by you and it is,
therefore, not protected under this Policy.</p>
<p>The personal information that RMG gathers may include:
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

​(1) Your name and job title;</p>
<p>​(2) Your telephone;</p>
<p>​(3) Your physical address, mailing address, and Email address;</p>
<p>​(4) Your postal zip code;</p>
<p>​(5) Demographic information such as your preferences and interests; and</p>
<p>​(6) Other information of a similar nature that is relevant to the
services that RMG offers, such as advertisements, surveys and special
offers.
</div>

</div>

<strong>b. Usage Information.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

For the purposes of this Policy the term
“usage information” means information that is gathered by tracking how
you use the Site, which includes, but is not limited to, the frequency
with which a link is used and the frequency and duration that a
particular page or pages are viewed, and the number of “visits”, “hits”,
or “viewings” a particular page, product, or service received by users
of the Site (collectively, “Traffic Patterns”).
</div>

<strong>c. Limitations on the Collection of Personal Information.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

You may
elect to limit or prevent the collection of personal information in the
following ways:
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

​(1) Whenever you are asked to provide information to enter, register
for, or receive information from a Site, you may decline to do so.</p>
<p>​(2) If requested, or if you want, to receive Email promotions or other
promotions from RMG, locate and “click” the box that indicates that you
do not want the information to be used by anybody for direct marketing
purposes. Users of our service may get a quarterly email concerning
changes in our system, new functionality, profile statistics, and
advertisements. Advertisements will not be delivered unless the User
includes a value added message about their account. In addition to the
quarterly email, Users may be contacted by email or telephone for
account verification, account transfer, site maintenance, or other
issues pertaining to the Site. If, at any time, a user desires to stop
getting quarterly emails, the User may disable their account.</p>
<p>​(3) If you have previously consented to RMG’s use of your personal
information for marketing purposes, you may contact RMG to cancel your
consent as follows:<br>
Site Administrator<br>
Risk-Mitigation.Group<br>
<a href="mailto:admin@Risk-Mitigation.Group">admin@Risk-Mitigation.Group</a>
</div>

</div>

<strong>d. Personal Information Collected.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">
Personal information is collected
by RMG when you create an account. This includes: information used when
an account is created, search queries made on Insurance.Report (to track
billing) and fire department edits made by account holders on
FireDepartment.net. Personal information collected can be viewed by
logging into your account.
</div>

<strong>e. Viewing Personal Information.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

Personal information collected can
be viewed by logging into your account on FireDepartment.net or
Insurance.Report.
</div>

<strong>4. Use of Information Gathered by RMG.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

RMG gathers personal
information and usage information to provide better services through
interactive elements, posting opportunities, and content tailored to
your interests. RMG may use your personal information internally to
improve its products, information, and services. RMG will periodically
send you promotional information, Emails regarding products or services,
Email notification regarding the subject matter of the Sites, and other
information that RMG believes you may find interesting (collectively,
“Promotional Information”). RMG may also use your personal information
to contact you, personally, to participate in voluntary surveys
regarding the Site so that we may continue to improve your online
experience.</p>
<p>By using usage information and general information, RMG is able to
attract advertisers and sponsors who will offer products, goods, or
services that are of interest to you. RMG uses personal demographic
information and usage information, including Traffic Patterns, to market
the Site to advertisers, sponsors, affiliates, or business partners;
however, RMG does not maintain this type of personal information based
on the patterns of any particular user and the information used for this
purpose does not include personal information by which you may be
identified or contacted by third parties.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive Promotional Information, your options are
as follows:</p>
<p>​a. You may decline to register to use the Site, in which case you will
not be allowed access to the Site; or</p>
<p>​b. You may elect to access areas of the Site that are static and do not
require you to provide any personal information; when prompted for
personal information, you may simply cancel the operation and you will
be directed away from that Site.
</div>

<strong>5. Non-Disclosures.</strong>
The disclosures of information that are not
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

deemed to be disclosures of personal information by a business for a
third party’s direct marketing purposes are as provided under California
Civil Code Section 1798.83(d), which is incorporated herein by this
reference.
</div>

<strong>6. Security, Information Sharing, and Notice.</strong>
RMG will not share the
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

personal information of any particular user of the Site. We will not
sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties
unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. You will
be provided notice in the most expedient time possible and without
unreasonable delay in the event there is any breach of the security of
RMG’s data system, which is consistent with the legitimate needs of law
enforcement or any measure necessary to determine the scope of the
breach and restore reasonable integrity to the data system.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that in accordance with the laws governing Civil
Subpoenas, we may be required by law to release information to a third
party about your account, including the content of your communications
within the web site. Except as prohibited by law, we will send you
notice if we plan to comply with a civil subpoena related to your
account. You agree to hold us harmless for the release of any
information related to your account in connection with a civil subpoena
including, but not limited to, any claims that you did not receive
notice of the civil subpoena.
</div>

<strong>7. Website Links.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

RMG’s Site contains “links” to other websites.
When you click on a link, you are directed to a different web site. RMG
is not responsible for the privacy policies of such other web sites. RMG
encourages its users to read the privacy policies of each web site that
collects your personal information before accessing or using the
particular web site. RMG is not responsible for, and makes no
representations or warranties concerning, the privacy policies of any
web site other than this Site and RMG shall not be responsible for any
use of your personal information by any other website for which a link
is provided on the Site.
</div>

<strong>8. Cookie Tracking.</strong>
<div style="padding-left:30px;">

A “cookie” is a small file which asks permission
to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. If you agree to allow a
cookie to be installed on your computer, a text file is added. Once
installed, the cookie helps analyze your traffic patterns. The cookie
will allow RMG to track your use of the Site based upon information that
you have knowingly and voluntarily provided. The only personal
information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.
Cookies assist RMG to provide you with a better website, by enabling us
to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in
no way gives RMG access to your computer or any information about you,
other than the data you choose to share with RMG.</p>
<p>You may decline to allow RMG to install a cookie on your computer by
setting your browser preferences to refuse cookies. However, cookies are
required in order to login and create an account. Without an account,
users will not be able to perform tasks like searching for nearest fire
stations, nearest fire hydrants or manage fire department’s profile.
</div>
