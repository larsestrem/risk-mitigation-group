   <h1>Risk Mitigation Group, LLC</h1>
   <p>Risk Mitigation Group is the parent company for the websites listed below. Our goal is to collect and share information between multiple industries. By doing so, we have been able to collect better information than working with each industry independently.</p>
   <p><b><a href="https://risk-mitigation.group/">Risk-Mitigation.Group</a></b> - Parent company of websites listed below.</p>
   <p><b><a href=https://FireDepartment.net>FireDepartment.net</a></b> - Helping fire departments get online, recruit volunteers & share information with the communities they serve. Fire administrators and firefighters can scroll to the bottom of their fire department profile and request to manage their fire department's profile. Community members and insurance agents can also suggest additions and updates that will be reviewed before being added to the database.</p>
   <p><b><a href=http://FireEngineAcademy.com>FireEngineAcademy.com</a></b> - Resource for new fire engine operators to learn about operating a fire engine. Topics include pump discharge pressure and fire engine pump and plumbing. We are looking for a fire academy interested in publishing content to FireEngineAcademy.com and FrictionLossCalculator.com in exchange for marketing to a combined 17,000 visitors a month.</p>
   <p><b><a href=http://FrictionLossCalculator.com>FrictionLossCalculator.com</a></b> - Resource for new operators to learn about fluid dynamics. Friction loss is one of the most difficult topics related to operating a fire engine.  We simplified the process and provide multiple ways to solve and learn more about friction loss. We are looking for a fire academy interested in publishing content to FireEngineAcademy.com and FrictionLossCalculator.com in exchange for marketing to a combined 17,000 visitors a month.</p>
   <p><b><a href=https://Insurance.Report>Insurance.Report</a></b> - A service designed to help insurance agents find the nearest fire station and nearest fire hydrant for insurance inspections and underwriting. When either a hydrant or fire station can't be found, insurance professions often call the fire station requesting more information. Insurance.Report services saves a significant amount of time for the insurance industry and firefighters.</p>
   <p><b><a href=http://VolunteerFirefighter.info>VolunteerFirefighter.info</a></b> - Currently not published. </p>
   <p><b><a href="https://www.nvfirechf.org/">NVfirechf.org</a></b> - Official website for the Nevada Fire Chiefs Association. FireDepartment.net shares directory information with the Nevada Fire Chiefs Association in order to help them gain traffic and increase volunteer applications. As a result of this collaboration, volunteer applications increased over 75% compared to the contractor who previously provided volunteer recruitment services.</p>
