<p>Becoming a volunteer firefighter is a great way to serve your community and a personally rewarding experience. Over 70% of fire departments in the United States are staffed entirely by volunteers and over 90% of fire departments have volunteer firefighters. This means that if you are ready for the commitment of becoming a volunteer firefighter, there are fire departments that need your help.</p>
<h3>Are You Ready to Become a Volunteer Firefighter?</h3>
<p>Please, give it some serious thought before submitting a volunteer application. Volunteer fire departments run on tight budgets and can't afford to put you through an extensive training, to have you not show up or quit after a couple of fire calls. Becoming a volunteer firefighter is a commitment of your time and work as well as a responsibility to your community and fellow firefighters. Being a volunteer firefighter is also like being part of a big family, who looks out for each other. If you're an individual and want to do your own thing, fire-fighting may not be the place for you. As a firefighter, you depend on your fellow firefighters and they have to be able to depend on you. Below are some great videos that show some of the challenges, rewards and the lifestyle of being a volunteer firefighter.</p>

<h3>What should I say when calling a fire department about becoming a volunteer firefighter?</h3>
<p>Have a pen and paper ready to take notes. Call the fire department headquarters non-emergency number (Do Not Call 911), introduce yourself (&ldquo;my name is _______ _______, I live in ___________. Can I talk to someone about becoming a volunteer firefighter?&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you talk to the recruiter, introduce yourself again, tell them why you're interested in being a volunteer, and ask about the volunteer program. If you like what you hear, ask if they have a ride along program, and if there&rsquo;s an opportunity to meet the people you&rsquo;ll be working with if you become a volunteer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions to ask a volunteer recruiter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the fire department&rsquo;s minimum requirements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a ride along program?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there opportunities for me to meet others who work at the fire department prior to committing to become a volunteer firefighter?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the next volunteer training start?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the fire department pay for training?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What expenses do I have to cover as a volunteer?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you commit to becoming part of the fire department, it is a really good idea to determine if you fit in with those you'll be working with. Many fire departments have regular volunteer meetings or volunteer recruitment events that can be a great way to introduce yourself and get a feel for how the fire department operates. <br /><br /></p>
<p>Complete a volunteer firefighter application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take your time and fill out the application with the same care you would when applying for a paid position. It is well known that volunteering as a firefighter is a great way to get into the professional fire service and this can make some fire departments very competitive. Large cities, fire departments with great training programs and college towns (with volunteer housing) can get dozens (sometimes hundreds) of applicants a year.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The interview process. You may not realize, but the interview process started the first time you contacted the fire department. Your first impression makes a huge impact! If you are personable, professional and motivated, these are the qualities most volunteer fire departments are looking for. When you are talking to anyone at the fire department, relax, be yourself, be honest, and be the person other firefighters can depend on in the middle of an emergency.<br /><br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training program As mentioned above, most fire departments require a minimum of 110 hours of training before working as a firefighter. However, at the end of your initial training, you still have a lot to learn and some things can only be learned through experience. When you start as a firefighter, you'll be assigned to work with a more experienced firefighter to help instruct the many things you didn't learn in the initial training. Even 30 year veteran firefighters see something new almost every day!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not be discouraged if you don't get chosen after submitting an application.</p>
<p>If you really want to become a volunteer firefighter, apply at each of your local fire departments, keep applying and work to improve yourself (and your resume) by emulating the qualities needed to be a great firefighter. Learn new skills you can add to your resume and volunteer/participate in your community in other ways. Then, the next time you apply, you'll have a better chance.</p>
